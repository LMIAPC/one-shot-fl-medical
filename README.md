This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:

["A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19045)

We are currently organizing the code and will release it **soon**.
